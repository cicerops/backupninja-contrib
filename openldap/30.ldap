## The LDIFs generated are suitable for use with slapadd. As the 
## entries are in database order, not superior first order, they
## cannot be loaded with ldapadd without being reordered.

## backupdir (default /var/backups/ldap): the destination for the backups
# backupdir = /var/backups/ldap

# We're using the "slapcat" method by now
# method = slapcat
